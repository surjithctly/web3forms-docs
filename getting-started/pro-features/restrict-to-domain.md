# Restrict to Domain

{% hint style="info" %}
Heads Up! This is a PRO feature. You must have an active subscription to use this feature.
{% endhint %}

You can restrict the form from sending only through a whitelisted domain. This will potentially reduce spam attacks. So even if someone else got the access key, they cannot send emails to you. Only emails from your website are counted.

To enable this feature, you must add the domains you wanted to use in form settings. You can add multiple domains separated with comma. Do not add protocols like https:// in the domain name.

{% hint style="info" %}
Only root or subdomain allowed. Once added forms will only work on the added domain and it will not work locally. So you must add this feature only after testing.&#x20;
