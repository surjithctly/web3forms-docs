# FAQ

## 1. Access Keys

### Do I need to hide access key?

No. You do not need to hide the access key. Access key is public. No need to confuse it with secret API key. An access key is used to send emails to a particular email. It doesn't store any sensitive data. Think of it as an alias to your email, but one step harder.&#x20;

### What happens if someone else got my access key?&#x20;

Nothing much. What happens if you accidentally made your email address public? They can send you emails. Similarly, if someone else has access to your access\_key, they can only send you emails.&#x20;

### Can someone spam me if they got my access key?

Same as email address, they can use it to send you unsolicited emails. But Web3Forms has multiple security measures to prevent such things from happening. We have a firewall & active spam check algorithms which blocks spam emails reaching from your inbox.&#x20;

As a user, you have multiple additional options to protect your form.

### How to prevent spam and Protect my form?

To protect your form from unauthorized uses, you can use following measures:

1. A**dd Captcha:** This is a simple and effective way to stop such spam as each submission must have a valid captcha token. You can use multiple captchas such as [hCaptcha](customizations/spam-protection/hcaptcha.md), [reCaptcha](pro-features/recaptcha-integration.md) or [Turnstile](pro-features/cloudflare-turnstile-captcha.md)&#x20;
2. **Domain Restriction:** You can also enable domain restrictions on your form so that only forms submitted from your website will go through. All other submissions will be blocked. Please note that this is a pro feature.&#x20;

## 2. GDPR & Privacy

### Are you GDPR Compliant?&#x20;

We do not store any form submissions of our users. We process them and forward to your email or the endpoint you specified such as webhooks.
